# From Pandas DataFrame to Jdemetra+ with XML

This repo documents an effort to make it easier to transform a Pandas DataFrame to an XML-file that can be used as input data for seasonal adjustment with [Jdemetra+](https://jdemetradocumentation.github.io/JDemetra-documentation/) and [JWSACruncher](https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher/wiki). The XML is then compliant with the specification laid out on [p.15 of this document](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/jdemetra_user_guide.pdf).
